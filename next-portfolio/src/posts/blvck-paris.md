BLVCK Paris is a luxury e-commerce brand that was founded in 2017 by myself and my co-founder, Julian O'Hayon. What initially started as a black-themed Instagram page gained rapid online traction, amassing 80k followers before the launch of our first store. Our mission was to promote and inspire people to embrace the "All Black Lifestyle," a trend that involved incorporating minimalism, sophistication, and timeless elegance into their everyday lives.

The initial product launch was an enormous success, positioning us as a luxury streetwear brand. We meticulously designed and sourced our own distinctive products, developed unique packaging, and leveraged 3PL (3rd Party Logistics) companies to rapidly scale our operations and release seasonal collections. Today, BLVCK stands shoulder to shoulder with renowned luxury fashion brands and has established collaborations with industry giants such as Hugo Boss, Casetify, Fortnite, and has been prominently featured in Forbes.
