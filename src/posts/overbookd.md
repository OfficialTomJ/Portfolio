Overbookd is a web-based team and project management application designed to streamline productivity and foster efficient task management. Conceived by Julian O'Hayon and developed by Thomas Johnston, this application boasts a sleek and user-friendly card-based layout. Each card represents a project, milestone, or goal and includes a checklist to help users track tasks and meet deadlines.

The collaborative nature of Overbookd is exemplified by its real-time features, allowing teams to work together seamlessly. Users can add their entire team to projects, check off tasks, modify priorities, adjust due dates, and engage in real-time communication and file sharing through the Chatbox feature.

Under the hood, Firebase serves as the main service for delivering real-time functionality and user authentication.

During the development phase, a public beta version was released in May 2017, receiving positive feedback from users. The app's cross-collaboration capabilities and user-friendly task management interface resonated well with individuals seeking simplicity in their workflow management. Notably, we utilized Overbookd to manage the Overbookd project itself.

Key Features:

- Simple and intuitive UI/UX for effective project management (Cards -> Tasks -> Details).
