Developed as part of the Apple Foundation Program, VISION is an inspiring AI-powered image generation application designed to overcome creative "writer's block." The app enables users to capture their thoughts in sentences or bullet points, and it then summarises the most important ideas into a Showcase, providing inspiration and momentum for their creative endeavours.

The Showcase feature involves the generation of an AI image based on the provided thoughts. The process begins with ChatGPT, which processes the input and passes it to DALLE 2 for the creation of the final artwork. In addition to the artwork, ChatGPT generates the title and caption for each Showcase. Furthermore, each Showcase boasts a custom gradient background derived from the image, resulting in a visually stunning user interface.

The app seamlessly integrates with Firebase for user authentication and storage. This functionality allows users to save their Showcases within their accounts or save the artworks directly to their local devices, facilitating easy sharing with friends and across their social networks.
